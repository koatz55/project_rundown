Im Planning on making a fan page for a show called "The Boy's"
I really passionate  about the show. 
I didn't find fan pages like this so that is a problem needed to be solved. 
I belive it will bring the community of fans closer together
I will be using Python stack. It will have the standered login ands registration
it is left out to make room for the core part of the Planning.
